# tRPC

tRPC rightly has the tagline "Move Fast and Break Nothing.": It allows you to define an API that is typesafe. TypeScript will start warning you on the client-side if you changed a server-side return but didn't make the necessary changes on the frontend! tRPC also adds snappy autocomplete and much more.

This section will be extended soon. In the meanwhile, read the [trpc docs here](https://trpc.io/).
