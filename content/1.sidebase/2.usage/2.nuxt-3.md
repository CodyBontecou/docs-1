[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) is great - it has kept its promise of progressiveness and simplicity for web app development. It also has a rich ecosystem of libraries, modules and a sprawling developer community. [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) wraps Vue 3 to help us productive Vue 3 quicker than ever before: Fullstack web Apps, Statis Websites, PWAs and more are all possible with Nuxt 3. Nuxt also optimizes all of these modes heavily to provide the best user-experience (UX) and developer-experience (DX).
