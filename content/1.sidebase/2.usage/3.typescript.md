# TypeScript

TypeScript (TS) is essential because it provides guard-rails for development: TS let's us know what we talk about in our meeting when we discuss what the `roles: Roles[]` array contains, it informs our code-editor what we might be trying to do and let's it help us (think of GitHub Co-Pilot, but less AI), it guarantees certain kinds of correctness that we could only discover as a "bug" when our application was already deployed. The numerous benefits of TS are well known, if you want to read on, how about checking out [the official Why TypeScript page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/why-create-typescript).

This section will be extended soon. In the meanwhile, read the "why typescript" article linked above or watch Theos Typescript Rant:
