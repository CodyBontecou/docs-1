# First Steps

After running:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [yarn]
# Note: Due to a known problem with `yarn`, it is not possible to force yarn to always use `@latest`: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6587
yarn create sidebase
```
::

your app is already ready to go! We suggest that you just try it out to get started:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn run dev
```
::

If you have a database, e.g., by selecting Prisma ORM for the [Merino-stack](/sidebase/welcome/stacks) or by selecting the [Cheviot-stack](/sidebase/welcome/stacks), you should run `npx prisma db push` to sync your database schema to the database and have a look at your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to confgiure your database models. At the beginning it will just have an example model:
```
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  // NOTE: You probably want to change this to another database later on
  provider = "sqlite"

  // This value is read from the .env file.
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Example {
  id          String @id @default(uuid())
  details     String
}
```

Once you are happy you have to run `npx prisma db push` in order to sync these models to your database. Per default `sqlite` is configured, so you can start with development right away. For deployment you may want to switch to another database provider.
