# Prisma ORM

Prisma is an ORM for your database. ORM stands for "object relational mapping" and that's also what a classical ORM does: It maps tables from the database onto objects in your code!

This pattern is helpful for many reasons: It abstracts away your specific database, so you can switch from PostgreSQL to MySQL to sqlite3 without re-writing all your queries, it allows you to write queries in TypeScript so you don't have to learn an SQL dialect, it allows you to track the git-history of queries and your database schema clearly across versions.

This section will be extended soon. In the meanwhile, read the [`nuxt-prisma` module docs](/nuxt-prisma) or read prismas' own [Why Prisma? docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/overview/why-prisma).
