# Quick Start

To get started, run:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [yarn]
# Note: Due to a known problem with `yarn`, it is not possible to force yarn to always use `@latest`: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6587
yarn create sidebase
```
::

That's it! The CLI will guide you through the process:

## CLI Options

The CLI offers some options. These are experimental at the moment and will change and expand over the coming months:
- `--quick`: Quicker flow through CLI, mostly by skipping `🐑 Diamond` the friendly sheep-helper
