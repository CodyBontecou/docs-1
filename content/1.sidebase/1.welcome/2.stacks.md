# Stacks

As described in long-form in the [introduction](/sidebase/welcome) sidebase has a core comprised of [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). These two technologies are a must for all sidebase applications.

TypeScript (TS) is essential because it provides guard-rails for development: TS let's us know what we talk about in our meeting when we discuss what the `roles: Roles[]` array contains, it informs our code-editor what we might be trying to do and let's it help us (think of GitHub Co-Pilot, but less AI), it guarantees certain kinds of correctness that we could only discover as a "bug" when our application was already deployed. The numerous benefits of TS are well known, if you want to read on, how about checking out [the official Why TypeScript page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/why-create-typescript).

[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) is great - it has kept its promise of progressiveness and simplicity for web app development. It also has a rich ecosystem of libraries, modules and a sprawling developer community. [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) wraps Vue 3 to help us productive Vue 3 quicker than ever before: Fullstack Web Apps, Statis Websites, PWAs and more are all possible with Nuxt 3. Nuxt also optimizes all of these modes heavily to provide the best user-experience (UX) and developer-experience (DX).

We currently offer two stacks based on the sidebase core. Both have a different developer-experience. Both can deliver a stellar user-experience and can be deployed to all places that [Nuxt 3 supports out of the box](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#deployment).

The `create-sidebase` will walk you through the stack-selection and configuration process, simply run:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [yarn]
To use Merino, select "Merino" in the first step of the sidebase CLI.
# Note: Due to a known problem with `yarn`, it is not possible to force yarn to always use `@latest`: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6587
yarn create sidebase
```

Below the two stacks are described in greater detail, but you do not need this information to get started. Instead, you can run the above command and let the sidebase CLI guide you. You can figure out the rest as you get into your project.

## Merino

The Merino stack allows fine-grained pick and choose for a selection of modules, libraries, ... to add to the core. Merino is ideal if you want to use a version of sidebase that is tailored to your specific needs and slightly-less opinionated than the Cheviot stack. Merino is less ideal if you do not have the ressources or capabilities to customize and extend your starter beyond what the CLI offers or have troubles or do not want to bother with code editor configuration. Merino allows you to:
::list{type="success"}
- Select modules: Tailwind CSS, Naive UI, PrismaORM
- Auto-configure `nuxt.config.ts` for selected modules
- Git repository setup
- CI pipeline initialization: Github Actions
- Auto-install of configured packages and modules
::

To use Merino, select "Merino" in the first step of the sidebase CLI.

## Cheviot

The Cheviot stack is a batteries-included setup with a databse ORM, testing setup, a UI component library, Dockerfiles for deployment, configuration files to improve your VS Code editing experience, a linting setup with pre-selected eslint rules and more. Cheviot is ideal if you want to just get going with an opinionated stack that works. Cheviot is:
::list{type="info"}
- **Fullstack**: Develop frontend and backend in a single TypeScript code base
- **Fast to code**: Database, example tests, example components and example pages are all there for you to fill out
- **Fewer bugs**: Strong data-validation using `zod` to validate all transferred data, fully typed API-routes and strict DB models
- **Easy to use**: Designed to follow best practices and to be ready-to-go for development, without additional dev-dependencies like `docker` that make it hard to get started
- **Ready for launch**: Github Actions CI, Dockerfile, easy switch to most popular SQL-databases are all there, out of the box ([get in touch if you're missing something](https://github.com/sidebase/sidebase/issues/new/choose))
::

To use Cheviot, select "Cheviot" in the first step of the sidebase CLI.

In detail, Cheviot proved the following for production ready, robust, maintainable, fullstack applications:
::list{type="success"}
- Fullstack [`Vue 3`](https://vuejs.org/) + [`Nuxt 3`](https://nuxt.com/),
- Database models, migrations, queries and easy DB-switching via [`Prisma`](https://www.prisma.io/),
- Frontend- and Backend data-transformation via [`nuxt-parse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sidebase/nuxt-parse) and [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod),
- In-memory development SQL-database via [`sqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html),
- Linting via [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/),
- Test management, Test UI, component snapshotting via [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/),
- Component tests via [`test-library/vue`](https://testing-library.com/),
- Nuxt 3 native API testing via [`@nuxt/test-utils`](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/testing),
- Code coverage via [`c8`](https://github.com/bcoe/c8),
- CSS utilities via [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/),
- CSS components via [`Naive UI`](https://www.naiveui.com),
- Type checking in script and template via [`Volar / vue-tsc`](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar)
- Code editor configuration via `.editorconfig` files and a portable `.settings/` folder whith best-practice VS Code settings and extensions for Vue 3 / Nuxt 3 development

To facilitate this `sidebase` bootstraps a Nuxt 3 project that permits developing a backend and a frontend using just Nuxt 3 with overarching TypeScript support. We want to show the world how enjoyable end-to-end typescript programming can be, displacing the myth that JS/TS-backends are no good. This starter solves a lot of the "real-world" problems that occur after you start using Nuxt or any other framework: How to write backend tests? How to write component tests? How to calculate test coverage? How to integrate a database? How to build a docker image? ...?
