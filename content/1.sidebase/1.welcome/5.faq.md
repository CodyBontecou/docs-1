Frequently asked questions about sidebase.

## How do I build my app?

All stacks that sidebase generates are ready for development. They are also kept minimal, so that nothing get's in the way and you don't have to delete half of the files are running the CLI:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [yarn]
# Note: Due to a known problem with `yarn`, it is not possible to force yarn to always use `@latest`: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6587
yarn create sidebase
```
::

If you chose the ["Merino" stack](/sidebase/welcome/stacks) there will be less files and guidance, with the ["Cheviot" stack](/sidebase/welcome/stacks) there will be a bit more support.

In both cases it's best to just follow the final output of the `create sidebase` command to get the app running in development mode. The output can for example look like this:
```sh
# üêë Diamond:
# ‚ú® Project setup finished. Next steps are:
cd my-sidebase-app   // Enter your project directory
npx prisma generate  // Generate the prisma client
npm run dev          // Start the development server, use CTRL+C to stop
```

If you're not familiar with the technologies that are used here, we suggest that you [get help](/sidebase/welcome/getting-help) or read through the introductions of each technology in the usage section:
- [First steps](/sidebase/usage)
- [Nuxt 3](/sidebase/usage/nuxt-3)
- [TypeScript](/sidebase/usage/typescript)
- [Prisma ORM](/sidebase/usage/prisma)
- [Tailwind CSS](/sidebase/usage/tailwindcss)

## What about other modules like tRPC or authentication?

We're hard at work to add more options to the "Merino" stack. Authentication and tRPC are the two main priorities that are up next. If you want to give your vote for one of them, reach out on Twitter, on Discord or Github (links on the [getting help page](/sidebase/welcome/getting-help)). Right now you can already:
- add auth yourself using [our nuxt-auth modules](/nuxt-auth)
- add tRPC using the [nuxt trpc module by wobsoriano](https://github.com/wobsoriano/trpc-nuxt)

If you think anything else should be added sooner rather than later reach out!

## Where can I get help?

See the [getting help page](/sidebase/welcome/getting-help) for info on this. There you will find links to get help via our Discord or repo

## What coding setup can you recommend?

We recommend that you:
- Editor: [Use VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the mainstream, widely used code editor
- Plugins:
    - use [`Volar`](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar) for proper `.vue` and `.ts` highlighting,
    - use [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to enforce some basic rules for all files,
    - use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for formatting AND style
    - use [prisma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) for formatting, highlighting and intellisense for your `schema.prisma`
    - use [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) for tailwind intellisense, formatting and help
- Node / npm version: Use Node 18 if you can, but at least Node 18, install it via `nvm`, as described in [the node setup guide](/sidebase/ressources/coding-setup). See [this repo for Node release schedules](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)
- OS: Use any operating system you like

## What are inspirations for sidebase?

Some inspirations are:
- [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/): We love their simplicity & focus on TypeScript
- [remix](https://remix.run/): We love their aspiration and believe in the Web being able to deliver good, fast and reliable user-experiences
- [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/): We love their modular approach that enhances every JS-ecosystem or app, independent of what stack one wants to use
- [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/): We love their focus on building something productive and helpful, rather than something that solves all theoretical problems
